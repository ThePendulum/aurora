# aurora ws28xx Remote for Raspberry Pi

## Installation
aurora relies on Node.js, which is best installed through [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Node.js comes with a package manager npm, which is used to install aurora's dependencies:

`npm install`

To start aurora, run `app.js` through node:

`node app`

## Color channels
There are RGB and HSV color channels available. When one of the RGB channels gets modified, the HSV channels will be ignored. Likewise, when an HSV channel gets modified, the RGB channels will be ignored.

### RGB
The RGB channels represent red, green and blue respectively. Each channel accepts a value between 0 and 255. By combining all three channels, over 16 million colors can be created. All RGB channels are capped, meaning values above 255 will be truncated to 255.

### HSV
The HSV channels represent hue, saturation and value, a [cylindrical representation](http://i.imgur.com/iYzgRRI.png) of the RGB color model. The hue channel accepts a value between 0 and 360 (degrees) on a [color wheel](http://i.imgur.com/5UpyIGh.png). The saturation and value channels accept a value between 0 and 1, and represent the colorfulness and brightness respectively. The HSV channels are most suitable for e.g. color cycling and brightness fading and pulsing, as a single HSV channel can affect all colors of the RGB color model at once. The hue channel refers to a color wheel and values above 360 degrees will simply reset to 0 degrees, while the saturation and value channels are capped to 1.

### Synchronization
When the an RGB or HSV channel is updated, the other channel group will synchronize when possible. This behavior can be disabled with the synchronization toggle.

### Mathematical expressions
A static color can look charming, but to make things more exciting, our LEDs should come to life! Each color channel is powered by a mathematical expression parser that provides access to [tons of mathematical operations](http://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html), which become especially powerful in combination with the variables aurora makes available.

### Variables
The color channels RGB and HSV support expressions with the following variables:

#### Dimensions and positions
* `length` or `l`: The total number of LEDs.
* `index` or `i`: The sequential position of a LED.
* `width` or `w`: The width of the matrix. Equivalent to `length` on a strip.
* `height` or `h`: The height of the matrix. Always 1 on a strip.
* `x`: The x-coordinate of an LED in a matrix. Equivalent to `i` on a strip.
* `y`: The y-coordinate of an LED in a matrix. Always 0 on a strip.

#### Animation seeds
* `beat` or `b`: An incremental value that ticks every update cycle.
* `random[1-4]` or `r[1-4]`: An array of 4 random values between 0 and 1 for every update cycle.
* `pixelRandom` or `pr`: A random value between 0 and 1 unique for every LED for every update cycle.

#### Time
* `time` or `t`: Numbers of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
* `year` or `yr`: The current year in four digits.
* `month` or `mo`: The current month between 1 and 12.
* `date` or `d`: The current date or day of the month.
* `day`: The current day of the week between 1 and 7.
* `hour` or `hr`: The current hour of the day between 0 and 23.
* `minute` or `m`: The current minute of the hour.
* `second` or `s`: The current second of the minute.
* `millisecond` or `ms`: The current millisecond of the second.

### Examples
For all examples, we will use a LED strip with 100 LEDs or a LED matrix with 256 LEDs in a 16 by 16 configuration. Many examples will only work as intended on strips with individually addressable LEDs.

#### Warm white

**H**

#### Color cycle

**H**: `beat`

The beat variable increments by 1 on every update cycle. By applying this to the hue channel, each LED will cycle through the 360째 color wheel the hue channel represents by 1째 per update cycle. To speed up or slow down the color cycle, you may multiply (`*`) the `beat` variable by a value higher or lower than 1 respectively.

#### Flowing rainbow

**H**: `index + beat`

For long strips, the simplest flowing rainbow is created by mapping each LED `index` to a degree on the color wheel. The first LED will have an index 0, representing 0째 on the color wheel; a solid red. The 91st LED with index 90 will map to 90째 on the color wheel, which represents a solid green. By adding the `beat` variable, each LED will cycle through the color wheel with its `index` offset in mind, resulting in a flowing rainbow effect.

**H**: `index / length * 360 + beat`

The simple flowing rainbow requires at least 360 LEDs to display the entirity of the color wheel at once. To map the full color wheel over a strip of any length, the length of the strip must be used in the expression. By dividing the index of each LED by the length of the strip, all LEDs are mapped linearly to a value between 0 and 1. By multiplying this value by 360, the color wheel will be spanned entirely.

#### Chase

**V**: `(index + beat) % 3 ? 0 : 1`

The chase effect turns adjectant LEDs or and off as to create the illusion of motion. The expression combines a ternary and modulo operator on the value channel to create logic that turns on every 3rd LED. By adding the `beat` variable, this pattern is shifted forward every update cycle.
